The two python files are the solutions to the two parts of the problem. They are written in python 3.7.4. The code is thouroughly commented, so look at that to understand what has been done. The Map.py file has been edited to better fit the implementation of the problems, but the main parts are the same as the original file provided by the problem.

Part2 uses most of it's logic exactly like part1, with the import addition of logic for cell values. The path shortest path is found by running find_path() function in the corresponding python file. This is already done for you, so all you have to do to get a visualization of the path is running the file. A visualization each path is also provided in the delivery as png files.
